Multiple Junction 3D benchmark description

Four grains are initiated in the box in order to check the Young's angles at the 
quadruple junction as the first nontrivial configuration (the two and three 
grains junctions are trivial). No driving force is applied. All interface 
energies and mobilities are identical. The code uses the frame movement 
in order to keep the quadruple junction in the center of the simulation box.

The box size is 101x101x101 grid points. The input parameters are:

grid spacing:         dX    = 10^{-6} m, 
time step:            dt    = 10^{-4} s, 
interface mobility:   mu    = 4*10^{-9} m^4/(J*s), 
interface energy:     sigma = 0.24 J/m^2, 
interface width:      eta   = 4.5*dX.

The free boundary conditions are used in the simulation. After the start of the 
simulation the interfaces begin to evolve due to the curvature differences at 
the multiple junctions. The evolution continues until all the interfaces are 
straight and the angles between neighboring grains at the multiple junctions are 
identical.

The output data in vtk format is written in the VTK directory and can be directly 
visualized using the Paraview software (www.paraview.org).
