Lattice Boltzmann Gravity Test
==============================
This is a simple test to verify the correct implantation gravity in the lattice
Boltzmann solver. A solid and a liquid sphere are initialized. If the gravity
is correctly implement, both should fall at approximately the same
velocity.

TODOS:
------
+ Compare to analytic solution
+ Automate evaluation
