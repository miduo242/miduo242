Multiple Junction 2D benchmark description

Four grains are initiated in the box in order to check the Young's angles 
at the triple junction. No driving force is applied. All interface energies and 
mobilities are identical by default but interface energies can be changed 
to study the contact angle dependence on the interface energy difference.

The box size is 101x1x101 grid points. The input parameters are:

grid spacing:         dX    = 10^{-6} m, 
time step:            dt    = 10^{-4} s, 
interface mobility:   mu    = 4*10^{-10} m^4/(J*s), 
interface energy:     sigma = 0.24 J/m^2, 
interface width:      eta   = 5*dX.

Periodic boundary conditions are used in the simulation. After the start of the 
simulation the interfaces begin to evolve due to the curvature differences at 
the triple junctions. The evolution continues until all the dual interfaces 
are straight and the angles between neighboring grains at the triple junctions 
are identical. This should result in the "honeycomb" structure if identical 
interface energies are used for all interfaces.

The output data in vtk format is written in the VTK directory and can be 
directly visualized using the Paraview software (www.paraview.org).
