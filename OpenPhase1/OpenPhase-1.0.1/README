OpenPhase is an open source software library for the phase-field simulations 
of complex scientific problems. It is written in object-oriented C++ and has
a modular structure. Each module is dedicated to solve a single problem along
the phase-field simulation strategy. The brief documentation can be found in
the /documentation directory.

A quick introduction to the compilation and use of the OpenPhase library is 
given in the INSTALL file.
