Equilibrium Crystal Shape example (ECS)

A simulation of an initially spherical grain inserted in the melt in a 
simulation box. No thermodynamic driving force is applied to the grain 
boundaries, thus only the effect of the interface curvature anisotropy 
is active during the simulation.

The box size is 64x64x64 grid points. The input parameters are:

Initial number of grains:  2, 
grid spacing:         dX    = 10^{-7} m, 
time step:            dt    = 10^{-1} s, 
interface mobility:   mu    = 1*10^{-14} m^4/(J*s), 
interface energy:     sigma = 0.2 J/m^2, 
interface anisotropy strength per facet family: k = 0.3, 
interface width:      eta   = 5*dX.

After the start of the simulation, the grain begin to take its equilibrium
shape, minimizing the interface curvature by means of the interface energy
anisotropy as a function of the inclination angles.

The simulation output data in vtk format is written in the VTK directory and 
can be directly. Visualized using the Paraview software (www.paraview.org).
