Solid Phase Sintering (Surface Diffusion Only)
==============================================

The example demonstrated the solid phase sintering process between two or solid
spheres while also the internal stress field is computed. Surface diffusion is assumed to be the only mechanism of transport while the grain volume is conserved. Hence, the effect of surface diffusion can studies without any evaporation condensation, physical or numerical!
