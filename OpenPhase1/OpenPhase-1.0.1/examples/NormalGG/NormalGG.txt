Normal grain growth example (NormalGG)

The simulation domain is populated with a set of grains generated according to 
the Voronoi algorithm. No thermodynamic driving force is applied to the grain 
boundaries, thus only the effect of the interface curvature is active during 
the simulation.

The box size is 100x100x100 grid points. The input parameters are:

Initial number of grains:  200, 
grid spacing:         dX    = 10^{-6} m, 
time step:            dt    = 10^{-5} s, 
interface mobility:   mu    = 4*10^{-7} m^4/(J*s), 
interface energy:     sigma = 0.24 J/m^2, 
interface width:      eta   = 5.0*dX.

After the start of the simulation, the grains begin to grow to minimizing the
interface area. The simulation output data in vtk format is written in the 
VTK directory and can be directly visualized using the Paraview software
(www.paraview.org).
