Two dimensional simulation of the heat transfer between a compressible flow and a packed bed of spherical particles.

An array of spherical cylinders by phase number 1 surrounded by air which enters the box from bottom by phase number  0 is simulated.

The simulation is being executed by MPI Parallel. The numbers of cores used in each directions:
Number of cores in X Direction:                         Ncx           = 8,
Number of cores in X Direction:                         Ncy           = 1,
Number of cores in X Direction:                         Ncz           = 6,
Total Number of cores used in this simulation:              Np = Ncx*Ncx*Ncx  = 48,
