The modules that are currently available use only standard features of the C++, 
but it requires the FFTW3 external library (www.fftw.org). The Makefiles are 
configured to use GNU g++ compiler and the code should compile on any Linux 
platform with g++ version 9.0 and later. The library should also compile with 
any other C++ compiler which fully implements C++17 standard and is currently 
tested with g++, clang++, Intel icpc and DPC++ compilers. To change the compiler
just use 'make CXX=<preferred_compiler_name>' which works for the g++, clang++ 
and DPC++ compilers. If you decide to use Intel icpc compiler you should 
manually change corresponding lines in the Makefile.

In order to compile the OpenPhase library just run 'make' in the distribution 
root directory. This will compile the library and place it into the ./lib 
directory. In order to compile examples run 'make examples'. Examples are 
located in the ./examples directory. In order to run them you should navigate 
into the examples directory and follow the instructions in the README file.
In order to compile the benchmarks to test the library run 'make benchmarks'. 
In order to run them enter the ./benchmarks directory and follow the 
instructions in the README file.

By using 'make SETTINGS="<option1> <option2> ..."' additional compile options 
can be added. Note that the OpenMP parallelism is enabled by default.
Currently the following options exist:

serial:         No OpenMP parallelization.
mpi-parallel:   Compiles OpenPhase with MPI support.
debug:          Compiles OpenPhase with debug information and enables additional 
                output and checks via the DEBUG flag.
silent:         Disables most of the console output from the library (incomplete).

The library assumes that each module that requires user input will read it 
from a dedicated input file. The input files (with the .opi file extension) are
located in the corresponding example directories.

Technical description of the library implementation can be obtained using 
"doxygen" (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). Just run 'doxygen' command 
in the distribution root directory. The documentation will be created in 
the ./documentation directory. We have commented most of the header files 
and some of the implementation details, but this is not yet completed.
A detailed manual for the library should be available from the project's 
web page (www.openphase.rub.de) in the near future.
