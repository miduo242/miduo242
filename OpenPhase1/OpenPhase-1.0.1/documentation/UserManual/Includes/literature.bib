     abstract = {A class of high-resolution algorithms is developed for advection of a scalar quantity in a given incompressible flow field in one, two, or three space dimensions. Multidimensional transport is modeled using a wave-propagation approach in which the flux at each cell interface is built up on the basis of information propagating in the direction of this interface from neighboring cells. A high-resolution second-order method using slope limiters is quite easy to implement. For constant flow, a minor modification gives a third-order accurate method. These methods are stable for Courant numbers up to 1. Fortran implementations are available by anonymous ftp.},
