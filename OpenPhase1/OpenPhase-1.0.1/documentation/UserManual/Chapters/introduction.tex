The manual shall provide a guide line for new users of OpenPhase and phase-field simulation in general, and it provides the basic definitions which are needed to understand the basics of the multi-phase field method, get acquainted with the basic conventions in the module package and provide a reference for users and programmers. Section (\ref{tb}) will provide the theoretical basis OpenPhase is grounded on. Section (\ref{PC}) will define the most important parameters and conventions of the code. Section (\ref{comp}) describes how to construct and compile an executable for an individuals simulation. Section (\ref{Ex}) describes introductory example simulations.
