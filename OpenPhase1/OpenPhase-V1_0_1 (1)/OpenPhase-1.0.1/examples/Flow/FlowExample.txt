Mg-Al solidification with buoyancy flow example.

A spherical solid grain of phase 1 surrounded by the liquid phase 0 is considered.
The solid grain is placed in the center of a square box with periodic boundary 
conditions. Buoyancy flow is simulated using the lattice Boltzmann method.

The box size is 101x1x101 grid points.
