This document provides a desription of the SolidificationMgAl example of OpenPhase (www.openphase.de).

This example is dedicated to simulation of Mg-Al alloy solidification. 
The relevant parameters of the alloy are set in the ProjectInput.opi file.

The entries of the linearized phase diagramm are given by $Ts_(A)_(B) and $Cs_(A)_(B) which 
indicate the points of intersection of the solidus/liquidus/solvus lines for a pair 
of phases (Ts - is the temperature while Cs is corresponding composition). 
The first index (A) is always indicating the phase with which given line of the phase 
diagramm is in direct contact, while the second index (B) is indicating a complimentary 
phase which form a dual phase region with phase (A). Parameters ML_(A)_(B) and ML_(B)_(A) 
set the corresponding solidus/liquidus/solubility lines slopes. The slopes in contact with the 
stoichimetric phase lines are set to "0.0" ("inf" is not a good input value). 
A phase can be marked as stoichiometric (no diffusion, no solubility, fixed concentration) 
using the parameters $Flag_(A). Value "0" is used for nonstoichiometric phases and any nonzero 
value can be used for stoichiometric ones. 

In this example the phase with index (0) coreesponds to the Mg-Al melt, while index (1) corresponds 
to the HCP Mg-Al phase and index (2) denotes the beta phase. The respective initial 
phase concentrations are set by the parameters $C0_(A), where (A) is again a phase index. 

Parameters $CMIN and $CMAX are used for numerical bounds of the phase concentrations. 
They can be any physically correct value between 0 and 100 %. Narrower intervals 
are some times preferred when for example a phase does not exist outside of certain 
concentration range.

The temperature dependent diffusion coefficients D_(A) for a phase (A) are set by a pair 
of DC_(A) (diffusion coefficient) and AE_(A) (activation energy) parameters of 
the Arhenius formula: 

D_(A) = DC_(A) * Exp[-AE_(A)/(R*T)], 

where R is a gas constant. If activation energy is set to 0.0 the diffusion 
coefficient becomes temperature independent: D_(A) = DC_(A).

Parameters relevant for temperature settings are $R0(X,Y,Z) which set the starting 
point of the applied temperatre gradient in the simulation box. The starting temperature 
value $T0 is set as the starting value at the point $R0(X,Y,Z) and then the temperature 
gradient given by the parameters $DT_DR(X,Y,Z) is applied starting from this value/point.
The cooling/heating rate $DT_Dt is applied in all simulation points equally in each 
time step, providing the temperature change by $DT_Dt * $dt value, where $dt is the 
time step.
