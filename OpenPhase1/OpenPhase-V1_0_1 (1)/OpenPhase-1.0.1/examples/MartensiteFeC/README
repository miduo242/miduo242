This is a README file for the MartensiteFeC example.

To operate this example, follow the following steps:

1- To compile the test example, type in the terminal: $ make
2- For MPI users, compile using: $ make SETTINGS=mpi-parallel
3- To run the test simulation run $ ./MartensiteFeC
4- For MPI users run using: $ mpirun -np <no of cores> ./MartensiteFeC
5- The ProjectInput.opi file contains the necessary input for the simulation.
   The default ProjectInput.opi file for the test simulation is using Carbon=0.1 wt.%
6- If you would like to use different carbon content, rename the corresponding
   ProjectInput file before using them. The default name used by the simulation
   is ProjectInput.opi
7- The results will be placed into the /VTK directory and can be visualised 
   using the ParaView (www.paraview.org).

A detailed description of the simulation setup is given in 
"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2019.06.036".

Note, that this example is reduced to linear elasticity and is presented 
to show the simulation setup. The results will be different from those in the
paper above.
