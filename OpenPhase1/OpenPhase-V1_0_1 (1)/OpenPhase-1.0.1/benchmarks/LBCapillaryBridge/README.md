Inverse Ripening Large
======================
The Capillary bridge benchmark is defined to benchmark the liquid, vapor and
solid interaction. Therefor, a liquid bridge with the radius R is initialized
between two plate. The simulations results are compared to an analytic
solution. Details are publish in [1].
