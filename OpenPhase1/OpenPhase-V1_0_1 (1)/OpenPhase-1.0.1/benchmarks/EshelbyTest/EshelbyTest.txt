Eshelby Test description

In this simulation the following elasticity data are used:
Eigenstrain: 	1%
Poisson ratio: 	0.3
Elasticity modulus: 	208 GPa

which correspond to the set of elastic constants:

C11 = 280 GPa,
C12 = 120 GPa,
C44 =  80 GPa.

The system size is 129x129x129 grid points and the interface width is 5 grid points. 
Boundary conditions are periodic which are imposed by the spectral elasticity solver. 

The output data in vtk format are written in the VTK directory and can be directly 
visualized using Paraview software (www.paraview.org).
