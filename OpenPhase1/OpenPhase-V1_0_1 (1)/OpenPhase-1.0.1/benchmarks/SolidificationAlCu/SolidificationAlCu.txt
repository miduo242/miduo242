Diffusion-controlled directional solidification of Al-Cu alloy (SolidificationAlCu).

The growth of a single dendrite in the process of directional solidification is
simulated. Material parameters are for an Al - 4.0 at.% Cu alloy:

Melting point of pure Al:                   T_melt  = 933.6 K, 
Entropy change during solidification:       delta_S = 10^6 J/(m^3 K), 
Diffusion coefficient of Cu in liquid Al:   D_liquid =  3*10^9 m/s^2.

The linearized phase diagram is used with constant partition coeffcient 
k = C_solid/C_liquid = 7.14. The liquidus slope is 2.6 K/at %.

A constant temperature gradient in the Z direction, Gz = 1000 K/m, and
constant cooling rate, dT/dt = -0.4 K/s, are applied resulting in pulling
velocity V = -(dT/dt) / Gz = 0.0004 m/s.

The box size is (Nx*Ny*Nz) 71x71x301 grid points, the grid spacing 
dx = 1*10^{-6} m and the time step dt = 5*10^{-5} s. 

The simulation box starts to move along with the growth of the dendrite when 
the dendrite tip reaches Nz/3 grid point.

After an initial transient, a single finger of a steady shape growing with a
constant velocity (equal to the pulling velocity) should be obtained.
