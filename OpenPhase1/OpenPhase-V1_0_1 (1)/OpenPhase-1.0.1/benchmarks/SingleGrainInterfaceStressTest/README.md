Single Grain Interface Stress Test
==================================
The benchmark checks the correctness of the InterfaceStress module. This
is done by association of an elastic interface tension with a Al grain inside a
Al matrix phase. The resulting pressure difference can be compared to the
analytical solution. Additionally the solution can be compared with a molecular
dynamics solution by executing "plot_pressure_profile.sh" .
